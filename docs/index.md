# Welcome to MEDEA docs

This site contains the documentation for the MEDEA receiver, Rokubun's
dual-frequency GNSS receiver with IMU, barometer and time event logger.
This receiver is based on the u-blox ZED-F9P chipset.


## Components

This section includes a description of the sensors and chips included in 
the MEDEA sensor board.

In summary:

- The GNSS antenna (active or passive) can be connected to the receiver via
  an SMA connector
- The USB-C connector serves the purpose of providing the power supply to the
  board as well as transfering the data to a host computer. You can use this
  port to connect the receiver to Ublox U-center program, stream data to 
  a NTRIP caster using RTKlib, ...
- The ublox ZED-F9P GNSS chipset has been shielded to reduce interference and
  jamming and have the best possible Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR), which in 
  turns serves to obtain a more robust positioning
- All the data generated by the sensors are timetagged by the Atmel microcontroller
- The IMU measurements are provided by the InvenSense MPI9250 (9 degrees of 
  freedom, accelerometers, gyro and magnetometers)
- The board contains also a Barometer (BMP388) that can be used to reduce 
  the uncertainty in the Up direction.
- All the measurements are logged in an SD card that can be inserted in the
  available SD card slot
- In the back of the board
